# Milestone 3 Implementation Overview

## Template Catalog Governance
- Added dedicated template catalog administration endpoints for managing categories, optional template types, and per-template assignments.
- Categories and types are now stored in first-class catalog tables; existing templates fall back to a default "General" category when not explicitly assigned.
- Template listing payloads expose structured category/type metadata and accept dynamic filters.

## Audit Log Viewer
- Introduced `/api/admin/audit/logs` for browsing audit events with pagination, filters, and strict response envelopes.
- Sensitive fields remain suppressed by default; admins can opt-in to include email addresses when required.

## Notifications Foundation
- Added `/api/notifications` for secure user access to notifications, plus admin publishing capabilities with SendGrid email dispatch and per-user channel preferences.
- Notification schemas persist audiences, dispatch metadata, and respect preference-driven rate limiting.

## Usage Analytics
- Application launches and template downloads now emit usage metrics stored in the `usage_metrics` table and forwarded to Application Insights (when configured).
- Metrics capture company, subject, and role/tier dimensions for downstream dashboards.

## Operational Polish
- Consolidated schema bootstrapper guarantees new tables exist across supported databases on startup.
- Standardized rate-limit headers, audit event typings, and error responses in the touched endpoints.
